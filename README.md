# Spell checker system

This spell checker system is a collective work with my friends, Justin Ng and Wengie Wong for our university NLP project. This spell check system attempts to rectify any non-word errors and real word errors detected from GUI input texts.   
This system focus on rectifying spelling errors that are related to astrological terms. Hence, a book titled "The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need" has imported as corpus for this system.
